# 📍 Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm (Python Implementation)

## 📖 Overview

This project provides a clean, modular implementation of **Dijkstra's algorithm** in Python to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.  
Developed as part of a map navigation system module.

## 👨‍💻 Role: Algorithm Developer (Person 2)

**Responsibilities:**
- Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path and total distance.
- Write clean, modular, and efficient Python code.
- Test the algorithm with sample inputs to ensure accuracy.
- Return both the shortest path and its total distance from the start node.

---

## 📌 Features

- Uses a **priority queue (min-heap)** for efficient node selection.
- Tracks distances from the start node to all other nodes.
- Reconstructs the shortest path using a backtracking method.
- Includes test cases to validate correctness.
